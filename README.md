# Welcome

This is a repository of various projects relating to the trombone.

The initial focus will be transcription of works in the Public Domain, which are commonly used in audition, study and performance. It is my fervent hope that individuals who may otherwise be unable to obtain copyrighted editions of these classic works of music in print may freely view, edit, and generally make use of these open digital versions to further their own musicianship and thereby enrich both their own lives and that of those around them. I intend minimal editing of the original works, which are the focus of this project. However, in cases where minor modifications may make the artifacts avaialable herein eligible for copyright, and to the extent which I am permitted to do so, I release said artifacts back into the Public Domain, via [Creative Commons zero (CC0)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license#Zero_/_public_domain). 

I welcome any and all contributions to this effort, and I will endeavor to credit all contributions. My preferred software for transcription is [musescore](https://musescore.org/en). I have no direct ties to that project, but I appreciate its free and open source nature, as democratization of technology is a movement near and dear to my heart. Contributions using other music software will of course be considered, providing that licensing restrictions do not conflict with goals of the project.
