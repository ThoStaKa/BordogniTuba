# Anton Sláma

Anton Sláma (1804-1881) was a professor of the Vienna Conservatory, best known to trombonists for his "66 Etudes in All Major and Minor Keys".

## 66 Etudes in All Major and Minor Keys

These studies have been used for many years by students of the trombone, tuba, bassoon, and string bass. The first study in each key is a basic scale pattern, followed by brief but challenging studies in the same major and relative minor key. For these transcriptions, we draw from the 1922 Carl Fischer publication, which has now passed into the Public Domain. The Internet Archive, with funding from the University of Toronto digitized this edition in 2010, and made it available [here](https://archive.org/details/66etudesinallmaj00slam/page/n5/mode/2up).
