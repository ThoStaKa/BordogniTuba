# Victor Cornette

Victor Cornette was born in 1795 - incidentally, the same year that the Paris Conservatory opened. The son of an organist, Cornette would grow to become a prominent musician with diverse talent spanning multiple instruments. He studied music with Jean-François Lesueur, the same teacher of composers Hector Berlioz and Charles Gounod. 

## Method for Trombone

Cornette wrote books for many instruments, including one of the first method books for trombone. The first edition of his trombone method was published in 1831 and later (sometime before 1842) expanded. One of the most enduring sections of Cornette's trombone method was his "Six Grand Etudes", which appeared in multiple collections by other authors, including a reprint (without credit) in Oskar Blume's 36 Studies, as well as in the 3rd volume of Robert Müller's technical studies (included with attribution in this case). One of these six (#3) etudes appears in Himie Voxman's Selected Studies for Trombone, a set of works referenced in all-state auditions across the US for many years.
