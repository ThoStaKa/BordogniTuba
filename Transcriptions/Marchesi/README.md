# Marchesi Vocalises

Mathilde Marchesi was a German mezzo-soprano, best known as a teacher of many great vocalists. She composed a number of bel canto vocalises between the mid- and late-1800s. 

## Opus 13

This set of 12 Elementary Vocalises is easily adapted for the trombone. The vocalises in this set are generally shorter and more approachable as compared with other vocalises from Marchesi or Bordogni. The original keys have been retained in these transcriptions, as the melodies (down an octave from the original) generally fall into a comfortable tessiatura for the tenor trombone. However, the narrower range for most of these vocalises would make transposition into other keys/ranges a good exercise to extend the benefit of these works as studies. Metronome markings used in the audio exports fall within the generally accepted ranges for the tempos indicated.
